## :dart: Objectives

Sometimes it's difficult to show what you have done in your life as a developer. At this point, i decided to create a portfolio to show what technologies i used in my career and what i'm studying at the moment.

## ðŸš€ Deploy

This project is running at Vercel.

Remember that it uses two pipelines, making CI/CD easier.

The main one runs on the **MASTER** branch that will only change if the administrator accepts a pull request after the code review.

The second is a preview branch that shows changes to secondary branches.

This project also makes use of **GITHUB ACTIONS** to run some automated tests when receiving a push/pull request.
